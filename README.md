## Difference Between SX and LX

**Understand the key distinctions between SX and LX fiber transceivers.**

- **SX Modules:** Short-range, multimode fiber, typically up to 550m  
- **LX Modules:** Long-range, singlemode fiber, distances up to 10km or more  
- SX is ideal for intra-building connections, LX for inter-building or campus networks  
- Both support standard Ethernet speeds like 100Mbps and 1Gbps  

Perfect for network planners needing the right balance between distance, fiber type, and cost.

## SFP Module Compatibility Guide

**Ensure seamless integration with your switches and media converters.**

- Check manufacturer compatibility and supported speeds (100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps)  
- Verify fiber type (singlemode vs multimode) and connector type (LC, SC)  
- Hot-swappable modules simplify upgrades without downtime  
- Consider industrial or rugged variants for harsh environments  

Essential for IT teams and integrators deploying scalable fiber optic networks.

## Choosing Fiber for Security Cameras

**Select the right fiber optic solution for surveillance systems.**

- Singlemode fiber for long-distance, high-resolution cameras  
- Multimode fiber for short-range, cost-effective deployments  
- Consider environmental factors: outdoor, indoor, or ruggedized applications  
- Ensure low-latency, interference-free video streaming for continuous monitoring  

Ideal for government facilities, commercial buildings, and critical infrastructure.

## BiDi vs Duplex SFP

**Compare bidirectional (BiDi) and duplex SFP modules.**

- **BiDi SFP:** Transmits and receives data on a single fiber using WDM technology, reducing cabling costs  
- **Duplex SFP:** Uses two fibers (one for transmit, one for receive) for standard full-duplex communication  
- BiDi is compact and cost-efficient; duplex is traditional and widely compatible  
- Choose based on fiber availability, network layout, and budget  

Useful for network engineers planning high-density or single-fiber deployments.
